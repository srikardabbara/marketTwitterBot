This is a twitter bot that tweets updates specific stock market updates that the common investor would be interested in.

Features:
    1. Every morning at market open + 1 minute, tweet the current price of each index and the change
    Any time there is a big change to a stock in the market tweet out the name of the stock and what the change was
    2. Anytime a stock moves more than 5% it will tweet the ticket and delta to alert users of a big move

Goal:
    The goal of this tiwtter bot is to aid causal, long term, investors such as myself who don't necessarily follow the news or markets to get alerts 
    for any significant news we may be interested in. It also helps users keep track of stocks as they may not be aware of any big changes to a stock in their 
    portfolio unless they are intentional with it.

Usage Examples:
    You own stock XYZ in your portfolio. News came out about a big investment XYZ came out with and is causing the stock to skyrocket. 
    Unless you are activley following news about XYZ or were checking your portfolio that day and saw XYZ climing, you may have missed your 
    opportunity to sell/buy more of XYZ. With post notifications on however, you can get alerted that XYZ gained more than 5% as soon as it 
    breaks that mark and act upon it. 
    
    You have cash waiting around and are trying to figure out when the best time to invest is. Getting the alert every morning allows you to 
    know wether the market is up or down without having to go onto a website or check yourself. 

    You have cash and not sure what stock to invest in. twitter bot allows you to activley monitor big movers to see if a stock is down significantly 
    that you may want to buy while low. Or you want to hop on the train of a stock that is trending significantly upward it allows you to do that as well.
